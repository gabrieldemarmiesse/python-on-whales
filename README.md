## Main features

* 1 to 1 mapping between the CLI interface and the Python API. No need to look in the docs
what is the name of the function/argument you need.
* Support for the latest Docker features: 
[Docker buildx/buildkit](https://github.com/docker/buildx), 
`docker run --gpu=all ...`
* Support for Docker stack, services and Swarm (same API as the command line).
* Progress bars and progressive outputs when pulling, pushing, loading, building...
* Support for some other CLI commands that are not in [Docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): 
`docker cp`, `docker run --cpus ...` and more.
* Nice SSH support for remote daemons.
* Docker object as Python objects: Container, Images, Volumes, Services... and their
attributes are updated in real-time!
* Each Docker object can be used as a context manager. When getting out of the 
context, the Docker object is removed automatically, even if an exception occurs.
* A fully typed API (Mypy and IDE-friendly) compatible with `pathlib` and `os.path`

## Why another project? Why not build on Docker-py?

In a sense this project is built on top of [Docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
because the implementation, the organisation and the API is inspired from the project, but the codebases 
could not be the same.

Two major differences do not permit that:

1) The API is quite different. The aim of Python on Whales is to provide a 1-to-1 
mapping between the Docker command line and Python, so that users don't even have 
to open the docs to do write code.

2) While [Docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a complete re-implementation of the Docker client binary 
(written in Go), Python on whales sits on top of the Docker client binary, which makes 
implementing new features much easier and safer. For example, it's 
[unlikely that docker-py supports Buildx/buildkit](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/2230#issuecomment-454344497)
anytime soon because rewriting a large Go codebase in Python is hard work.

## Should I use Docker-py or Python on Whales?

Well, it's written in each project's description!

* Docker-py: A Python library for the Docker Engine API
* Python on whales: An awesome Python wrapper for an awesome Docker CLI


If you need to talk to the Docker engine directly, you need to do low level operations,
use docker-py. Some good example would be writing the code to control docker from an IDE, 
or if the speed of Docker calls is very important. 
If you don't want to depend on the Docker CLI binary (~50MB), use docker-py.


If you wanted to call the docker command line from Python, 
do high level operations, use Python on Whales.
For example if you want to write your CI logic in Python rather than in bash (a very good choice 😉).
Some commands are only available in Python on whales 
too: `docker.buildx.build(...)`, `docker.stack.deploy(...)`...

Use the right tool for the right job 🙂

## Where is the project now? Where is it going?

Currently, about 85% of the Docker CLI API is covered. Of course the most used functions 
were done first: docker run, docker pull, docker push, docker build (with buildx), docker volume...

If you look around the docs, you might find a few functions that are not implemented yet.

This project aims at a 100% feature parity between the Docker CLI and Python on whales. 

This includes Docker buildx, Docker app, Docker Swarm, Docker stacks and Docker compose.

You can consider that this software is in beta, some small API changes are still possible.
 
 
## What about the license?

It's a MIT license, so quite permissive.
