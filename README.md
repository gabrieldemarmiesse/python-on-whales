## Main features

* 1 to 1 mapping between the CLI interface and the Python API. No need to look in the docs
what is the name of the function/argument you need.
* Support for the latest Docker features: 
[Docker buildx/buildkit](https://github.com/docker/buildx), 
`docker run --gpu=all ...`
* Support for Docker stack, services and Swarm (same API as the command line).
* Progress bars and progressive outputs when pulling, pushing, loading, building...
* Support for some other CLI commands that are not in [Docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): 
`docker cp`, `docker run --cpus ...` and more.
* Nice SSH support for remote daemons.
* Docker object as Python objects: Container, Images, Volumes, Services... and their
attributes are updated in real-time!
* Each Docker object can be used as a context manager. When getting out of the 
context, the Docker object is removed automatically, even if an exception occurs.
* A fully typed API (Mypy and IDE-friendly) compatible with `pathlib` and `os.path`

## Why another project? Why not build on Docker-py?

In a sense this project is built on top of [Docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
because the implementation, the organisation and the API is inspired from the project, but the codebases 
could not be the same.

Two major differences do not permit that:

1) The API is quite different. The aim of Python on Whales is to provide a 1-to-1 
mapping between the Docker command line and Python, so that users don't even have 
to open the docs to do write code.

2) While [Docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a complete re-implementation of the Docker client binary 
(written in Go), Python on whales sits on top of the Docker client binary, which makes 
implementing new features much easier and safer. For example, it's 
[unlikely that docker-py supports Buildx/buildkit](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/2230#issuecomment-454344497)
anytime soon because rewriting a large Go codebase in Python is hard work.


## Where is the project now? Where is it going?

Currently, about 75% of the Docker CLI API is covered. Of course the most used functions 
were done first: docker run, docker pull, docker push, docker build (with buildx), docker volume...

The main parts missing are Docker swarm support, Docker buildx builders management, and a better inspection 
of Docker objects like volumes and images (for Docker containers, the inspection is pretty good).

This project aims at a 100% feature parity between the Docker CLI and Python on whales. 

This includes Docker buildx, Docker app, Docker Swarm, Docker stacks and Docker compose.

You can consider that this software is in beta, some small API changes are still possible.
 
 
## What about the license?

It's a MIT license, so quite permissive.
